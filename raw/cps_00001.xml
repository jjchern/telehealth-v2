      <txt><![CDATA[CPSID is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies households across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MIS). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. CPSID Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSID is available elsewhere.

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

Users may also want to see CPSIDP for more information about linking individuals across time using a person-specific version of CPSID.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0. For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls. IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights.]]></txt>

      <labl>Covered by Medicaid last year</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[HIMCAIDLY indicates whether the respondent was covered by Medicaid during the previous calendar year. The data in HIMCAID were edited by the Census Bureau and assign Medicaid coverage to some persons who did not report such health insurance during questioning. For general discussion of Medicaid funding and eligibility, see CAIDLY.

For 1980-1987, information on health insurance coverage was collected only for persons age 15 and above. The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by Medicaid, the public assistance program that pays for health care? Who was that?" The Census Bureau edited the data to allot coverage (a "yes" response in HIMCAIDLY) to some children, as well as to some categories of adults who did not provide an affirmative response to the Medicaid question. All children under age 21 in families were assumed to be covered by Medicaid if either the householder or spouse reported being covered by Medicaid. All adult AFDC recipients and their children, and SSI recipients living in states which legally required Medicaid coverage for persons receiving Supplemental Security Income, were also coded as "yes" in HIMCAIDLY.

Beginning in 1988, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on Medicaid coverage for all household members, of all ages. With the introduction of computer-assisted interviewing technology (CATI) in 1994, the interviewer also asked about Medicaid coverage by referring to the state-specific names of Medicaid programs in the state where the household was located.

After 1987, the Census Bureau continued to edit the data in HIMCAIDLY, assigning Medicaid coverage to some persons who did not mention Medicaid during questioning. For example, in 1996 and 1997, HIMCAIDLY was coded as "Yes" if the individual reported coverage from Indian Health Service, or reported having "other government health care" or "other insurance" in a final, follow-up question about health insurance not previously acknowledged.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIMCARELY indicates whether the respondent was covered by Medicare during the previous calendar year. The data in HIMCARELY were edited by the Census Bureau and assign Medicare coverage to some persons who did not report such health insurance during questioning.

For 1980-1987, information on health insurance coverage was collected only for persons age 15 and above. The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by Medicare, the health insurance for persons 65 years old and over or persons with disabilities?" The Census Bureau edited the data to allot coverage (a "Yes" response in HIMCARELY) to all persons age 65 and older who reported income from Social Security. After 1988, the universe for Medicare recipients was still treated as persons age 15 and older, even though the survey generally focused on insurance coverage for all age groups.

Beginning in 1988, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on insurance coverage for all household members, of all ages. Because the universe for Medicare coverage was treated as persons age 15 and older, this basic change in the phrasing of insurance-related questions had less effect on HIMCARELY than on other insurance-related variables.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HICHAMP indicates whether the respondent was covered by CHAMPUS, VA, or other military health care during the previous calendar year.
 
For 1980-1987, information on military health insurance coverage was collected only on persons age 15 and above.  The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by CHAMPUS, VA, or military health care?  Who was that?"   Editing by the Census Bureau allotted coverage (a "yes" response in HICHAMP) to the child and adult dependents (e.g., children, spouse) covered by the policy of the household member enrolled in CHAMPUS or other military health care.      

For 1988-1993, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on military health insurance coverage for all household members, of all ages. With the introduction of computer-assisted interviewing technology (CATI) in 1994, information was collected through a series of questions, after the interviewer had asked about employment-based and privately-purchased insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare.  Specifically, the interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous calendar year], was anyone in the household covered by any other kind of health insurance, including CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, VA or military health care, or the Indian Health Service?  Who was that?  What plan were you covered by?"  Those who reported coverage by CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, or VA health care were coded as "yes" in HICHAMP.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[PHINSUR indicates whether the respondent reported being covered by a private (i.e., employment-based or privately-purchased, not government) insurance plan during the preceding calendar year.  

The term "covered by private insurance" in the direct question posed to respondents is ambiguous; coverage might mean either being a private insurance policyholder or having coverage as a dependent via someone else's private insurance policy.  Because some respondents interpreted the question in the former, narrower sense, the identification of persons covered by private insurance (either as policyholders or as dependents) via the Bureau's allocation program in COVERPI is more complete than the private health insurance coverage reported in PHINSUR.]]></txt>

      <labl>Covered by Medicaid last year</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CAIDLY identifies persons who reported Medicaid coverage during the previous calendar year. Interviewers defined Medicaid as "the government assistance that pays for health care," and they mentioned both federal Medicaid programs and the Medicaid programs specific to the state where the household was located when collecting this information.  

Medicaid pays for medical assistance to low-income families with dependent children and to aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical services. The program became law in 1965.  Medicaid is administered by state agencies and is jointly funded by the federal, state, and, sometimes, local governments. Eligibility requirements for this means-tested program vary across states.  All recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and most recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are eligible for Medicaid coverage.  In some states, other persons qualify, such as needy unemployed persons who have children and who are not receiving cash assistance, and medically needy persons whose income and assets are too low to cover their medical costs. Many Medicaid recipients are inmates of medical institutions, such as low-income elderly persons in nursing homes. Such institutionalized persons are not included in the CPS sample.

Through programming in IPUMS CPS, other cases were added to the pool of positive responses for the CAIDLY variable in the original public use data in 1996-2018.  If the respondent mentioned Medicaid coverage when answering a catchall summary question on "other" health insurance plans, after hearing questions about many specific types of insurance coverage (including Medicaid), then that person was given a positive response for CAIDLY in IPUMS CPS.]]></txt>

      <labl>State Children's Health Insurance Program coverage last year</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[SCHIPLY identifies children age 18 and younger who had health insurance coverage from the State Children's Health Insurance program during the previous calendar year.  Respondents were not questioned about SCHIP coverage (identified in the questionnaire as "the program that helps families get health insurance for children") if a child had Medicaid coverage. The computer-assisted interview program for the survey specified the name(s) for the SCHIP program(s) in the state where the household was located.

The State Children's Health Insurance Program was established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and provides federal funds to states to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured low-income children. States use SCHIP money to develop separate child health programs, expand their Medicaid programs, or both.  Both Medicaid and SCHIP are means-tested government health insurance programs. 

The number of children with SCHIP coverage reported in the CPS is much lower than the figures shown by enrollment data from administrative records. For example, in 2001, the corresponding figures were 2.3 million children according to the survey data, versus 3.3 million children according to administrative records. There are several reasons for this discrepancy.  Some respondents are unclear about the exact source of their government health insurance coverage, and some insurance coverage funded by SCHIP was channeled through Medicaid (see CAIDLY). Thus, many households in which children had SCHIP coverage reported Medicaid or "other" insurance as the source of children's health insurance. Moreover, if a child had Medicaid coverage, the interviewer did not ask about SCHIP coverage. This skip pattern in the questions excludes some SCHIP recipients who had Medicaid coverage for some months and SCHIP coverage for other months during the preceding calendar year.       

A Census Bureau publication states, "Because the SCHIP questions were designed as Medicaid follow-up questions and not to try to capture all SCHIP coverage, we do not recommend using the new question to estimate state SCHIP coverage rates, but rather as an additional component of public health insurance."  The Bureau also recommends examining unweighted results to ascertain whether there are enough cases to support analysis of SCHIP coverage for states or population subgroups.  The Census Bureau does not publish summary measures with a threshold of less than 75,000 weighted cases, or approximately 35 to 40 unweighted sample cases.  Fluctuations over time or differences between states or subgroups in SCHIP coverage should not be given substantive weight unless an adequate number of cases underlie the analysis.  Factors that vary between states--such as whether the SCHIP program has a different name than the state Medicaid program, how long the program has been in place, and how widely publicized the program is--could also produce apparent differences between states in the extent of SCHIP coverage reported in the CPS.     

Finally, researchers should note that the skip patterns described above do not appear to have been followed in all cases.  In 2006 and 2007, for example, almost one quarter of children who were under age 19 and who were receiving Medicaid provided valid responses to the SCHIP item.  In 2008-2010, information on SCHIP recipiency exists for all children, regardless of their Medicaid status.  While this information may be useful to some, researchers who wish to be fully consistent with the guidelines provided by the CPS documentation should ensure that all Medicaid recipients are coded as missing for the SCHIPLY variable.]]></txt>
