"1. Note: County of residence is misidentified in 316 deaths that occurred in the year 2000, for Hartford County, CT (FIPS code"

"2. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of"
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data."
